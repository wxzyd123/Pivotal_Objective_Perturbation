data/5339/5339_14133_000017_000002.wav|0|Their hearts were true and constant, whatever else might be their failings; and it is no new thing to 'damn the faults we have no mind to.'

data/5339/5339_14134_000094_000000.wav|0|With a heavy, heavy heart he creaked down the stairs, felt for his cap, and left the house.

data/5339/5339_14133_000018_000004.wav|0|Perhaps these bustling sounds prevented Sylvia from hearing approaching footsteps coming down the brow with swift advance; at any rate, she started and suddenly stood up as some one entered the open door.

data/5339/5339_14134_000018_000000.wav|0|It was settled that the next morning he was to make his way northwards to Hartlepool, whence he could easily proceed either by land or sea to Newcastle, from which place smacks were constantly sailing to London.
data/5339/5339_14134_000019_000000.wav|0|When he was once more behind the counter, he had leisure enough for consideration as far as Coulson could give it him.
data/5339/5339_14134_000013_000003.wav|0|Certain circumstances were mentioned regarding the transactions between the Fosters and this manufacturer, which could be known only to those who were in the confidence of one or the other; and to the Fosters the man was, as has been said, a perfect stranger.
data/5339/5339_14134_000041_000009.wav|0|Could he be playing the same game with Sylvia?
data/5339/5339_14133_000007_000002.wav|0|But it thus happened that they did not give the prompt assistance they were accustomed to render at such times; and Coulson had been away on some of the new expeditions devolving on him and Philip as future partners.

data/5339/5339_14134_000041_000010.wav|0|Philip set his teeth and tightened his lips at the thought of it.
data/5339/5339_14134_000033_000000.wav|0|'It's fine talking,' said Coulson, half mollified, and yet not caring to show it.
data/5339/5339_14134_000071_000000.wav|0|Sylvia's galloping thoughts were pulled suddenly up by his silence; she felt that he wanted her to say something, but she could think of nothing besides an ambiguous--
data/5339/5339_14134_000083_000001.wav|0|At the time, in his agitation, he saw, but did not affix any meaning to it, that the half of some silver coin was among the contents thus turned over before the box was locked.
data/5339/5339_14134_000017_000001.wav|0|In his own mind he forestalled the instructions of his masters, and was silently in advance of John Foster's plans and arrangements, while he appeared to listen to all that was said with quiet business-like attention.
data/5339/5339_14133_000023_000001.wav|0|Then he said--
data/5339/5339_14133_000037_000002.wav|0|At any rate, it was not unwelcome.
data/5339/5339_14134_000008_000000.wav|0|One of these seemed of especial consequence to the good brothers.

data/5339/5339_14134_000097_000001.wav|0|Philip knew the uselessness of remaining; the need for his departure; and yet he stood still for a little time like one entranced, as if his will had lost all power to compel him to leave the place.
data/5339/5339_14133_000004_000003.wav|0|She liked him better, too, than she had done a year or two before, because he did not show her any of the eager attention which teased her then, although its meaning was not fully understood.
data/5339/5339_14134_000056_000001.wav|0|Is she at home?' he asked of her father.
data/5339/5339_14133_000003_000002.wav|0|By degrees both Hepburn and Coulson were introduced to distant manufacturers and wholesale dealers.
data/5339/5339_14134_000018_000002.wav|0|Philip had never had so much in his hands before, and hesitated to take it, saying it was more than he should require; but they repeated, with fresh urgency, their warnings about the terrible high prices of London, till he could only resolve to keep a strict account, and bring back all that he did not expend, since nothing but his taking the whole sum would satisfy his employers.

data/5339/5339_14133_000041_000000.wav|0|Daniel laughed the more at this, especially when he caught Charley's look of disappointment.

data/5339/5339_14134_000095_000001.wav|0|Just at that moment the little casement window of Sylvia's room was opened, and she said--
data/5339/5339_14133_000040_000000.wav|0|'I can't come down again.
data/5339/5339_14133_000039_000000.wav|0|For a time there was no answer.
data/5339/5339_14134_000009_000003.wav|0|As the door of communication shut the three in, Coulson felt himself a little aggrieved.
data/5339/5339_14133_000007_000003.wav|0|One evening after the shop was closed, while they were examining the goods, and comparing the sales with the entries in the day-book, Coulson suddenly inquired--

data/5339/5339_14134_000097_000000.wav|0|The window was shut again as soon as the words were spoken.
data/5339/5339_14134_000064_000001.wav|0|Her father was right in saying that she might not have set out for Yesterbarrow.
data/5339/5339_14134_000091_000007.wav|0|Yet it seemed as though he could not stir.
data/5339/5339_14134_000041_000000.wav|0|His feelings, disturbed on this one point, shook his judgment off its balance on another.
data/5339/5339_14134_000040_000001.wav|0|He was chafed and excited by Coulson's words, and the events of the day.
data/5339/5339_14134_000019_000001.wav|0|The latter was silent, brooding over the confidence which Philip had apparently received, but which was withheld from him.
data/5339/5339_14134_000072_000000.wav|0|'Well?'
data/5339/5339_14133_000037_000004.wav|0|He wound up with a chuckle, as the thought struck him that this great piece of business, of disposing of their only child, had been concluded while his wife was away.

data/5339/5339_14134_000064_000000.wav|0|Philip promised to do his best, and to write word to Robson, who, satisfied with his willingness to undertake the commission, bade him go on and see if he could not find the lass.
data/5339/5339_14134_000016_000000.wav|0|As all this was being revealed to Philip, he sat apparently unmoved and simply attentive.
data/5339/5339_14134_000042_000002.wav|0|Secure and exultant, his broad, handsome, weather-bronzed face was as great a contrast to Philip's long, thoughtful, sallow countenance, as his frank manner was to the other's cold reserve.

data/5339/5339_14133_000037_000001.wav|0|And, perhaps, the elder man was not unprepared for the communication that followed.
data/5339/5339_14133_000025_000000.wav|0|He made for the door.
data/5339/5339_14134_000092_000007.wav|0|Can she be wearied out, and gone to sleep, he wondered.

data/5339/5339_14134_000091_000002.wav|0|He sate still in despair, his head buried in his two hands.
data/5339/5339_14134_000041_000006.wav|0|Coming along it, and so meeting him, advanced Daniel Robson, in earnest talk with Charley Kinraid.
data/5339/5339_14134_000013_000000.wav|0|It seemed from his account to Philip (explanatory of what he, in advance of his brother's slower judgment, thought to be a necessary step), that the Fosters had for some time received anonymous letters, warning them, with distinct meaning, though in ambiguous terms, against a certain silk-manufacturer in Spitalfields, with whom they had had straightforward business dealings for many years; but to whom they had latterly advanced money.
data/5339/5339_14134_000069_000001.wav|0|As it was, she scarcely took in the sense of his words.
data/5339/5339_14133_000025_000001.wav|0|He must have been pretty sure from some sign or other, or he would never have left it to her womanly pride to give way, and for her to make the next advance.
data/5339/5339_14134_000009_000002.wav|0|Philip, indeed, was quite idle when John Foster opened the parlour-door, and, half doubtfully, called him into the room.
data/5339/5339_14134_000022_000000.wav|0|Hester said nothing.

data/5339/5339_14134_000091_000006.wav|0|He knew he ought to be going home, for he had much to do, and many arrangements to make.
data/5339/5339_14133_000004_000001.wav|0|She was rather thinner and paler; but whatever change there was in her was always an improvement in Philip's eyes, so long as she spoke graciously to him.

data/5339/5339_14133_000006_000005.wav|0|The shops in the town were equally busy; stores had to be purchased by the whaling-masters, warm clothing of all sorts to be provided.
data/5339/5339_14134_000078_000000.wav|0|Suddenly a light shone down into Philip's mind.
data/5339/5339_14133_000024_000004.wav|0|'I may go back to where I came from,' he went on.
data/5339/5339_14133_000005_000003.wav|0|The widow-woman was to come and stay in the house, to keep Sylvia company, during her mother's absence.
data/5339/5339_14133_000002_000003.wav|0|Her life was quiet and monotonous, although hard-working; and while her hands mechanically found and did their accustomed labour, the thoughts that rose in her head always centred on Charley Kinraid, his ways, his words, his looks, whether they all meant what she would fain believe they did, and whether, meaning love at the time, such a feeling was likely to endure.
